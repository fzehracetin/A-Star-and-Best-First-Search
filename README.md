# A Star and Best First Search Algorithm
This is the implementation of A* and Best First Search Algorithms in python language. The project comprimise two data structures: stack and heap. So there is four algorithms in this project.

Search algorithms run on the images between start and end pixels. I add R value from RGB value to the h(n) and g(n) functions. Thus, algorithms tend to move from the red areas.
